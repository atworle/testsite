Ahnert et al assert that from Aristotle to Francis Bacon, networks have always influenced, or perhaps manifested in, our knowledge systems.1 Somewhat tied to this idea is their discussion of Milgram’s “Six Degrees of Separation”, they point out that the wonder the game fostered has been eroded in the ever more connected digital world. To this extent, the historical context of networks as an epistemological tool is important because losing the conscious acknowledgement of networks’ effect on our knowledge lends the risk of unwittingly being influenced by networks. To take it a step further, being unwittingly influenced by systems runs the risk of creating a ‘black box’ epistemology where knowledge is being increasingly generated by factors we do not fully understand and cannot sufficiently explain.\nAccording to Ahnert et al, network analysis is essentially generating connections which act as “formalizing abstractions that allow for computational analysis”. At its core then, network analysis is simply making connections between things, ‘formalizing them’ in the form of a network, then analyzing the results.2 Networks consist of ‘nodes’ or ‘vertices’, which function specific and identifiable things, and ‘edges’ or ‘links’ which represent types of connections. Networks can be as complex as a research question can make them. Nodes can be different colors and sizes to represent different groups or volumes. Edges can be different colors or different thicknesses to represent different types of connections or connection strengths respectively. These examples are merely scratching the surface of the complexity of networks. In essence, the way a network should be designed depends on its intended purpose but ultimately networks are meant to show connectivity. More specifically, networks have the potential to show hidden connectivity, they can uncover hidden, or previously unseen, relationships between historical events, people, or ideas.\nThe more intuitive use for networks is showing connections between people. Each person could be a node and connections between people could be an edge. You could modulate the strength of relationship between people by altering the style of the edge. The purpose of this would be to identify social networks and perhaps their limits or exclusions.\nAcross the Color line, a project by Gitre et al, uses a network made of words, or a ‘text correlation’ network. The words in their study are taken from a 1943 attitude and morale survey of U.S soldiers. They separated the responses by the race of the survey taker and further altered the network based on what they wanted to observe. The network consisted of nodes that were words which appeared in high frequency and edges which represented words that appeared frequently together.The network allowed Gitre et al to draw a number of conclusions which support historiographical intuitions about race and race relations during the 1940s. In essence, the survey responses were formalized into a network which showed clusters of words based on race, for example black soldiers had a network of responses related to race and struggle or race and place, while white soldiers had responses related to profession and combat or training and time off.3 Not only was the segregation of society reflected in the military but the authors also linked their findings to W.E.B Du bois’ ‘double consciousness’ by pointing out the links between the words ‘white’ and ‘negro’ or ‘white man’ and ‘black man’.4 This demonstrates the purpose of networks, their findings are intricately linked to their network. Another example of network analysis in the humanities would be the Viral Texts Project. The authors of this project look at texts published in the 19th century and ask “ What texts were reprinted and why? How did ideas—literary, political, scientific, economic, religious—circulate in the public sphere and achieve critical force among audiences”. There are multiple facets to this project and in fact the project functions more as a database but the authors specifically made a network of pre-civil war newspapers and magazines that printed the same texts. The network is very simple, it has nodes, which are newspapers and magazines, and the edges between them represent a shared text. The network allows one to see how connected newspapers and magazines were in the 19th century. More interestingly, the network shows newspapers or magazines that were extremely connected, shown by thick edges, and also newspapers that had far more shared story connections than others.\nAs for my own research, there are plenty of interesting uses for networks. One idea is to create a network of loyalists and patriot social relationships. The nodes would be people and the edges could be the strength of relationships determined by number of correspondences. Perhaps the patriots had more tight knit networks than the loyalist or perhaps the loyalist had a wider network and was therefore weaker or less effective. The purpose of the project would be to see how the different social structures of the patriots and loyalists differed and if that had any discernible outcome.\nBibliography Ahnert, Ruth, Sebastian E.
