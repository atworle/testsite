      <description>&lt;p&gt;          As well demonstrated in the Network Turn, networks are by no means a new concept nor are they a novel one. Ahnert et al assert that from Aristotle to Francis Bacon, networks have always influenced, or perhaps manifested in, our knowledge systems.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Somewhat tied to this idea is their discussion of Milgram’s “Six Degrees of Separation”, they point out that the wonder the game fostered has been eroded in the ever more connected digital world. To this extent, the historical context of networks as an epistemological tool is important because losing the conscious acknowledgement of networks’ effect on our knowledge lends the risk of unwittingly being influenced by networks. To take it a step further, being unwittingly influenced by systems runs the risk of creating a ‘black box’ epistemology where knowledge is being increasingly generated by factors we do not fully understand and cannot sufficiently explain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
