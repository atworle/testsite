[{"content":"\nTopic modeling is a complex method in theory but a fairly simple method in practice. In a conceptual sense, topic modeling consists of using algorithms to discover ‘topics’ in large bodies of text. In “Topic Modeling: A Basic Introduction”, Megan Brett explains topic modeling by referencing a twitter post during a conference which describes topic modeling as “a recurring pattern of co-occurring words”.1 Ben Schmidt attributes the ‘ease’ and ‘intuitiveness’ of topic models to underlying assumptions of coherency and stability.2 Coherency meaning that the list produced by a topic model algorithm contains words that are coherent in a list together, and stability, meaning if a topic exists in two different types of texts, the algorithm will have the ability to identify it.\nThe theory for topic modeling is relatively complicated for what the topic modeling actually produces. In a technical sense, topic modeling is a word modeling algorithm that matches words which co-occur frequently together across documents. There are various algorithms that topic model however the Latent Dirichlet Allocation, or LDA, is the one used most by humanists. LDA is a probabilistic model that functions based on two assumptions, that each document is a mix of topics and each topic is a mix of words. Probabilistic here means that the algorithm assigns probabilities for each word under a topic. So if election and president co-occur frequently then they will be grouped based on the probability that politics is a topic. There are varying levels of complexity to this process, for example you can select the number of topics and the number of words in each topic yourself and this can drastically alter the results.\nIt’s important to note a few things about this process. For one, the algorithm does not assign topic names, it simply groups words together. So the name of the topic is at the discretion of the researcher. Also, a document in this context is not necessarily a full document; it could be a paragraph or a page. However, the document is treated as a ‘bag of words’, meaning the order of the words does not factor into the algorithm’s calculation. Most importantly, as Schmidt points out, topic modeling only captures co-occurrence, it does not take into account the nuances of syntax, rhetoric, or figurative language.3\nThe possible uses are fairly distinct for history, however some scholars have attempted to discover new uses.4 The main utility of topic modeling lies in evaluating large corpuses, a corpus so large a human would not have the faculties or time to make sense of it. Topic models could help a scholar identify sources by linking documents via topics. Also a notable use, topic models can identify discourse analysis in a large corpora, such as 100 years of newspapers, and allow for analyzing key changes over time.\nThe findings of Lisa Rhody in “Topic Modeling and Figurative Language” are interesting but they also allow for a deeper understanding of topic models. She specifically states that between the “literary possibility held in a corpus of thousands of English-language poems” and the “computational rigor” of LDA, there is an interpretative space.5 The crux of her article centers around the topics contained in the poem “The Starry Night”. She points out that in its topic two, there are ‘intrusion’ words that only make sense in the list with a close reading of the poem. She then grouped poems based on the probability of topic two existing and found that although the top 15 poems with the highest topic probability did share a theme, the way they explore that theme is not encompassed by the topic. In that way, she shows that topic modeling coupled with close reading is an effective way to handle certain errors of topic modeling and LDA.\nAnother study that utilizes topic modeling in a novel way was Jo Guldi and Benjamin Williams’ “Synthesis and Large-Scale Textual Corpora: A Nested Topic Model of Britain’s Debates over Landed Property in the Nineteenth Century”. In the project they use what they call ‘nested topic models’ of nineteenth-century debates of Great Britain’s House of Commons and House of Lords. In essence, nested topic models are simply topic models that are grouped into hierarchical topics. For example, the topic voting could be nested in the topic of politics. In their study, they found that by nesting topics they could find varying levels of specificity in their topics which allowed for connecting topics to temporal events. In their own words, nesting topics allows for the “potential of better understanding hierarchical and governing relationships between large-scale concepts at the macro-level and actual events at the micro-level”.6 Image Credit: Jo Guldi, and Benjamin Williams. \u0026ldquo;Synthesis and Large-Scale Textual Corpora: A Nested Topic Model of Britain’s Debates over Landed Property in the Nineteenth Century.\u0026rdquo; Current Research in Digital History 1 (2018). https://doi.org/10.31835/crdh.2018.01.\nThe nested topic model concept could easily be applied to my own research. What I would do is topic model a newspaper that ran from 1754 to 1783, and determine the larger key topics. For example, I have no doubt politics would be a larger topic that would fit the scale of the time frame. Then attempt to discover the nested topics in order to glean political shifts. As an easy example, words like stamps, paper, or taxes would fit a topic under politics in 1766 but in 1776 politics might include things like tyranny and freedom. These are just the intuitive proof of concept examples, the hope would be that the actual practice of nested topics would provide new or novel ways of understanding discourses between 1754 and 1783.\nBibliography Brett, Megan R. “Topic Modeling: A Basic Introduction.” Journal of Digital Humanities 2, no. 1 (2012). https://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-a-basic-introduction-by-megan-r-brett/.\nGuldi, Jo, and Benjamin Williams. \u0026ldquo;Synthesis and Large-Scale Textual Corpora: A Nested Topic Model of Britain’s Debates over Landed Property in the Nineteenth Century.\u0026rdquo; Current Research in Digital History 1 (2018). https://doi.org/10.31835/crdh.2018.01.\nRhody, Lisa M. “Topic Modeling and Figurative Language.” Journal of Digital Humanities 2, no. 1 (2012). https://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-and-figurative-language-by-lisa-m-rhody/.\nSchmidt, Benjamin M. “Words Alone.” Journal of Digital Humanities 2, no. 1 (2012). https://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/words-alone-by-benjamin-m-schmidt/.\n“The Digital Humanities Contribution to Topic Modeling.” Journal of Digital Humanities 2, no. 1 (2012). https://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/dh-contribution-to-topic-modeling/.\nMegan R.

Ahnert et al assert that from Aristotle to Francis Bacon, networks have always influenced, or perhaps manifested in, our knowledge systems.1 Somewhat tied to this idea is their discussion of Milgram’s “Six Degrees of Separation”, they point out that the wonder the game fostered has been eroded in the ever more connected digital world. To this extent, the historical context of networks as an epistemological tool is important because losing the conscious acknowledgement of networks’ effect on our knowledge lends the risk of unwittingly being influenced by networks. To take it a step further, being unwittingly influenced by systems runs the risk of creating a ‘black box’ epistemology where knowledge is being increasingly generated by factors we do not fully understand and cannot sufficiently explain.\nAccording to Ahnert et al, network analysis is essentially generating connections which act as “formalizing abstractions that allow for computational analysis”. At its core then, network analysis is simply making connections between things, ‘formalizing them’ in the form of a network, then analyzing the results.2 Networks consist of ‘nodes’ or ‘vertices’, which function specific and identifiable things, and ‘edges’ or ‘links’ which represent types of connections. Networks can be as complex as a research question can make them. Nodes can be different colors and sizes to represent different groups or volumes. Edges can be different colors or different thicknesses to represent different types of connections or connection strengths respectively. These examples are merely scratching the surface of the complexity of networks. In essence, the way a network should be designed depends on its intended purpose but ultimately networks are meant to show connectivity. More specifically, networks have the potential to show hidden connectivity, they can uncover hidden, or previously unseen, relationships between historical events, people, or ideas.\nThe more intuitive use for networks is showing connections between people. Each person could be a node and connections between people could be an edge. You could modulate the strength of relationship between people by altering the style of the edge. The purpose of this would be to identify social networks and perhaps their limits or exclusions.\nAcross the Color line, a project by Gitre et al, uses a network made of words, or a ‘text correlation’ network. The words in their study are taken from a 1943 attitude and morale survey of U.S soldiers. They separated the responses by the race of the survey taker and further altered the network based on what they wanted to observe. The network consisted of nodes that were words which appeared in high frequency and edges which represented words that appeared frequently together.The network allowed Gitre et al to draw a number of conclusions which support historiographical intuitions about race and race relations during the 1940s. In essence, the survey responses were formalized into a network which showed clusters of words based on race, for example black soldiers had a network of responses related to race and struggle or race and place, while white soldiers had responses related to profession and combat or training and time off.3 Not only was the segregation of society reflected in the military but the authors also linked their findings to W.E.B Du bois’ ‘double consciousness’ by pointing out the links between the words ‘white’ and ‘negro’ or ‘white man’ and ‘black man’.4 This demonstrates the purpose of networks, their findings are intricately linked to their network. Another example of network analysis in the humanities would be the Viral Texts Project. The authors of this project look at texts published in the 19th century and ask “ What texts were reprinted and why? How did ideas—literary, political, scientific, economic, religious—circulate in the public sphere and achieve critical force among audiences”. There are multiple facets to this project and in fact the project functions more as a database but the authors specifically made a network of pre-civil war newspapers and magazines that printed the same texts. The network is very simple, it has nodes, which are newspapers and magazines, and the edges between them represent a shared text. The network allows one to see how connected newspapers and magazines were in the 19th century. More interestingly, the network shows newspapers or magazines that were extremely connected, shown by thick edges, and also newspapers that had far more shared story connections than others.\nAs for my own research, there are plenty of interesting uses for networks. One idea is to create a network of loyalists and patriot social relationships. The nodes would be people and the edges could be the strength of relationships determined by number of correspondences. Perhaps the patriots had more tight knit networks than the loyalist or perhaps the loyalist had a wider network and was therefore weaker or less effective. The purpose of the project would be to see how the different social structures of the patriots and loyalists differed and if that had any discernible outcome.\nBibliography Ahnert, Ruth, Sebastian E.

It has roots that go back to the late 19th century with legal scholars, archaeologists, and historians studying the concept of the “commons” in relation to collective ownership and spatial practices.1 In essence, this indicates early attempts to describe the spatial experience, attributing more value and weight to the ‘spatial’. Richard White stresses the fact that spatial history is about recognizing space as a “historical actor” instead of just a backdrop for historical events.2 With Foucault and Lefebvre’s intellectual frameworks the spatial turn evolved and gained more popularity in the 1970s and 1980s.3 The spatial turn eventually developed strong ties to the digital turn in the 1990s, with digital tools like GIS more widely being used by historians. Digital tools such as GIS and digital mapping have the potential to bring out the spatial in historical questions. This allows for an accentuation of the driving philosophy of spatial history, which ultimately is “How is the human experience shaped by space or vice versa?”.\nGIS is particularly tied to the spatial turn and spatial history because it encouraged the “reopening” of spatial questions and “enhanced the clarity” of spatial discussions.4 It also allowed for questions of far larger scale due to the amount of mappable information in archives. GIS has allowed the formalization of spatial analysis. This comes at a cost however; the discreteness and perceived objectivity of mapping has the potential to erode the implicit nuances of historical inquiry.\nBeyond GIS and digital mapping, understanding the epistemological roots of spatial history is crucial for understanding how it works and where it could be useful. Spatial history, at least according to its advocates, is theoretically always a useful lens to use for history. In essence, if space is viewed as an actor rather than just a backdrop, it must become a factor that every historian should consider, regardless of the time period or subjects of the study. In that way, spatial history is about teasing out the tendrils of space’s influence on history.\nOf course there are subjects in history that have more explicit spatial elements. For example, if one was studying historical newspapers, a consideration of the inherent spatiality of newspapers would be necessary. A blatant example would be a comparison of northern and southern newspapers during the civil war. The sectional spatiality of this study would be a crucial consideration in answering any historical questions. In general, any study involving urban environments would need to grapple with spatiality.\nThe more explicit uses for spatial analysis involve historical questions with explicit geographical or environmental underpinnings, however, a consideration of spatiality may reveal relationships or ideas not possible through typical historical analytical frameworks. Numerous digital projects use GIS or digital mapping in conjunction with spatial analysis to reveal new relationships and provide new analyses.\nThe Visualizing Emancipation is an example of using mapping to understand and reveal relationships that may be hidden by using only normal historical methods. This project has three mappable components “\u0026hellip;where slavery protected by the US government and where it was not during the Civil War; where and when U.S. troops campaigned during that war; and where \u0026ldquo;emancipation events…\u0026rdquo;. By mapping these things the project reveals that ‘emancipation events’ and union army positions have a spatial correlation.5 This relationship can really only be seen by mapping it. As an example, mapping the instances of union army contact and emancipation events show that enslaved peoples had a greater chance at freedom near rivers or the coast because union armies pushed into the confederacy by “water and rail”.6 Not only is this project displaying ‘patterns of emancipation’ but also this project ultimately presents the idea that emancipation was not an instanced event but it was an arduous, and oftentimes, violent process. The production of these ideas are very much tied to the spatial analysis provided by mapping.\nThe Mapping Early American Elections project has a far more explicit spatial component. The project maps voter counts of early American congressional elections, allowing one to see the dominant political parties by district. This project has a very clear spatial dimension because voting, specifically in the congressional elections, is a geographic act that is simple to display spatially. In the article, “ Maryland\u0026rsquo;s Political Geography in the Early Republic”, Greta Swain uses the maps in this project to show that geography shaped Maryland’s early American elections. For context, Swain explains that at the time of ratification of the U.S constitution, Maryland had two ‘distinct voting blocs’ consisting of wealthy landowners who favored taxes and the farmers and people affected by those taxes.[7] The compromise of 1790 further exacerbated this split and produced two distinct parties based on the two proposed sites in the compromise of 1790. The two parties went so far as to call themselves the ‘Chesapeake’ party and the ‘Potomac’ party perfectly exemplifying the local importance of a national issue. Even though parties and party names shifted, the specific split produced a long time rivalry which cut along geographic lines and continued well into the 1820s. The crucial spatial analysis here is that mapping allowed Swain to show that voting blocs can be spatially distinct and spatially defined in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\nIn terms of my own research, as stated earlier in this paper, there are always opportunities for spatial analysis. One idea could be mapping the printing of the federalist papers. If I could find newspapers that printed the federalist papers in each state, I could make a choropleth map that denoted instances of federalist pieces showing up in newspapers then compare this to a map of voting trends to see if the printing of federalist papers actually affected voting trends. This would point to larger questions about the role of newspapers or editorial pieces in political voting trends.\nBibliography Guldi, Jo . 2011. “What Is the Spatial Turn?” The Spatial Humanities, Scholars’ Lab, University of Virginia.

In that way, she shows that topic modeling coupled with close reading is an effective way to handle certain errors of topic modeling and LDA.\nAnother study that utilizes topic modeling in a novel way was Jo Guldi and Benjamin Williams’ “Synthesis and Large-Scale Textual Corpora: A Nested Topic Model of Britain’s Debates over Landed Property in the Nineteenth Century”. In the project they use what they call ‘nested topic models’ of nineteenth-century debates of Great Britain’s House of Commons and House of Lords. In essence, nested topic models are simply topic models that are grouped into hierarchical topics. For example, the topic voting could be nested in the topic of politics. In their study, they found that by nesting topics they could find varying levels of specificity in their topics which allowed for connecting topics to temporal events.

What I would do is topic model a newspaper that ran from 1754 to 1783, and determine the larger key topics. For example, I have no doubt politics would be a larger topic that would fit the scale of the time frame. Then attempt to discover the nested topics in order to glean political shifts. As an easy example, words like stamps, paper, or taxes would fit a topic under politics in 1766 but in 1776 politics might include things like tyranny and freedom. These are just the intuitive proof of concept examples, the hope would be that the actual practice of nested topics would provide new or novel ways of understanding discourses between 1754 and 1783.\nBibliography Brett, Megan R. “Topic Modeling: A Basic Introduction.” Journal of Digital Humanities 2, no. 1 (2012). https://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-a-basic-introduction-by-megan-r-brett/.\nGuldi, Jo, and Benjamin Williams. \u0026ldquo;Synthesis and Large-Scale Textual Corpora: A Nested Topic Model of Britain’s Debates over Landed Property in the Nineteenth Century.\u0026rdquo; Current Research in Digital History 1 (2018). https://doi.org/10.31835/crdh.2018.01.\nRhody, Lisa M. “Topic Modeling and Figurative Language.” Journal of Digital Humanities 2, no. 1 (2012). https://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-and-figurative-language-by-lisa-m-rhody/.\nSchmidt, Benjamin M. “Words Alone.” Journal of Digital Humanities 2, no. 1 (2012). https://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/words-alone-by-benjamin-m-schmidt/.\n“The Digital Humanities Contribution to Topic Modeling.” Journal of Digital Humanities 2, no. 1 (2012). https://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/dh-contribution-to-topic-modeling/.\nMegan R.

Ahnert et al assert that from Aristotle to Francis Bacon, networks have always influenced, or perhaps manifested in, our knowledge systems.1 Somewhat tied to this idea is their discussion of Milgram’s “Six Degrees of Separation”, they point out that the wonder the game fostered has been eroded in the ever more connected digital world. To this extent, the historical context of networks as an epistemological tool is important because losing the conscious acknowledgement of networks’ effect on our knowledge lends the risk of unwittingly being influenced by networks. To take it a step further, being unwittingly influenced by systems runs the risk of creating a ‘black box’ epistemology where knowledge is being increasingly generated by factors we do not fully understand and cannot sufficiently explain.\nAccording to Ahnert et al, network analysis is essentially generating connections which act as “formalizing abstractions that allow for computational analysis”. At its core then, network analysis is simply making connections between things, ‘formalizing them’ in the form of a network, then analyzing the results.2 Networks consist of ‘nodes’ or ‘vertices’, which function specific and identifiable things, and ‘edges’ or ‘links’ which represent types of connections. Networks can be as complex as a research question can make them. Nodes can be different colors and sizes to represent different groups or volumes. Edges can be different colors or different thicknesses to represent different types of connections or connection strengths respectively. These examples are merely scratching the surface of the complexity of networks. In essence, the way a network should be designed depends on its intended purpose but ultimately networks are meant to show connectivity. More specifically, networks have the potential to show hidden connectivity, they can uncover hidden, or previously unseen, relationships between historical events, people, or ideas.\nThe more intuitive use for networks is showing connections between people. Each person could be a node and connections between people could be an edge. You could modulate the strength of relationship between people by altering the style of the edge. The purpose of this would be to identify social networks and perhaps their limits or exclusions.\nAcross the Color line, a project by Gitre et al, uses a network made of words, or a ‘text correlation’ network. The words in their study are taken from a 1943 attitude and morale survey of U.S soldiers. They separated the responses by the race of the survey taker and further altered the network based on what they wanted to observe. The network consisted of nodes that were words which appeared in high frequency and edges which represented words that appeared frequently together.The network allowed Gitre et al to draw a number of conclusions which support historiographical intuitions about race and race relations during the 1940s. In essence, the survey responses were formalized into a network which showed clusters of words based on race, for example black soldiers had a network of responses related to race and struggle or race and place, while white soldiers had responses related to profession and combat or training and time off.3 Not only was the segregation of society reflected in the military but the authors also linked their findings to W.E.B Du bois’ ‘double consciousness’ by pointing out the links between the words ‘white’ and ‘negro’ or ‘white man’ and ‘black man’.4 This demonstrates the purpose of networks, their findings are intricately linked to their network. Another example of network analysis in the humanities would be the Viral Texts Project. The authors of this project look at texts published in the 19th century and ask “ What texts were reprinted and why? How did ideas—literary, political, scientific, economic, religious—circulate in the public sphere and achieve critical force among audiences”. There are multiple facets to this project and in fact the project functions more as a database but the authors specifically made a network of pre-civil war newspapers and magazines that printed the same texts. The network is very simple, it has nodes, which are newspapers and magazines, and the edges between them represent a shared text. The network allows one to see how connected newspapers and magazines were in the 19th century. More interestingly, the network shows newspapers or magazines that were extremely connected, shown by thick edges, and also newspapers that had far more shared story connections than others.\nAs for my own research, there are plenty of interesting uses for networks. One idea is to create a network of loyalists and patriot social relationships. The nodes would be people and the edges could be the strength of relationships determined by number of correspondences. Perhaps the patriots had more tight knit networks than the loyalist or perhaps the loyalist had a wider network and was therefore weaker or less effective. The purpose of the project would be to see how the different social structures of the patriots and loyalists differed and if that had any discernible outcome.\nBibliography Ahnert, Ruth, Sebastian E.

It has roots that go back to the late 19th century with legal scholars, archaeologists, and historians studying the concept of the “commons” in relation to collective ownership and spatial practices.1 In essence, this indicates early attempts to describe the spatial experience, attributing more value and weight to the ‘spatial’. Richard White stresses the fact that spatial history is about recognizing space as a “historical actor” instead of just a backdrop for historical events.2 With Foucault and Lefebvre’s intellectual frameworks the spatial turn evolved and gained more popularity in the 1970s and 1980s.3 The spatial turn eventually developed strong ties to the digital turn in the 1990s, with digital tools like GIS more widely being used by historians. Digital tools such as GIS and digital mapping have the potential to bring out the spatial in historical questions. This allows for an accentuation of the driving philosophy of spatial history, which ultimately is “How is the human experience shaped by space or vice versa?”.\nGIS is particularly tied to the spatial turn and spatial history because it encouraged the “reopening” of spatial questions and “enhanced the clarity” of spatial discussions.4 It also allowed for questions of far larger scale due to the amount of mappable information in archives. GIS has allowed the formalization of spatial analysis. This comes at a cost however; the discreteness and perceived objectivity of mapping has the potential to erode the implicit nuances of historical inquiry.\nBeyond GIS and digital mapping, understanding the epistemological roots of spatial history is crucial for understanding how it works and where it could be useful. Spatial history, at least according to its advocates, is theoretically always a useful lens to use for history. In essence, if space is viewed as an actor rather than just a backdrop, it must become a factor that every historian should consider, regardless of the time period or subjects of the study. In that way, spatial history is about teasing out the tendrils of space’s influence on history.\nOf course there are subjects in history that have more explicit spatial elements. For example, if one was studying historical newspapers, a consideration of the inherent spatiality of newspapers would be necessary. A blatant example would be a comparison of northern and southern newspapers during the civil war. The sectional spatiality of this study would be a crucial consideration in answering any historical questions. In general, any study involving urban environments would need to grapple with spatiality.\nThe more explicit uses for spatial analysis involve historical questions with explicit geographical or environmental underpinnings, however, a consideration of spatiality may reveal relationships or ideas not possible through typical historical analytical frameworks. Numerous digital projects use GIS or digital mapping in conjunction with spatial analysis to reveal new relationships and provide new analyses.\nThe Visualizing Emancipation is an example of using mapping to understand and reveal relationships that may be hidden by using only normal historical methods. This project has three mappable components “\u0026hellip;where slavery protected by the US government and where it was not during the Civil War; where and when U.S. troops campaigned during that war; and where \u0026ldquo;emancipation events…\u0026rdquo;. By mapping these things the project reveals that ‘emancipation events’ and union army positions have a spatial correlation.5 This relationship can really only be seen by mapping it. As an example, mapping the instances of union army contact and emancipation events show that enslaved peoples had a greater chance at freedom near rivers or the coast because union armies pushed into the confederacy by “water and rail”.6 Not only is this project displaying ‘patterns of emancipation’ but also this project ultimately presents the idea that emancipation was not an instanced event but it was an arduous, and oftentimes, violent process. The production of these ideas are very much tied to the spatial analysis provided by mapping.\nThe Mapping Early American Elections project has a far more explicit spatial component. The project maps voter counts of early American congressional elections, allowing one to see the dominant political parties by district. This project has a very clear spatial dimension because voting, specifically in the congressional elections, is a geographic act that is simple to display spatially. In the article, “ Maryland\u0026rsquo;s Political Geography in the Early Republic”, Greta Swain uses the maps in this project to show that geography shaped Maryland’s early American elections. For context, Swain explains that at the time of ratification of the U.S constitution, Maryland had two ‘distinct voting blocs’ consisting of wealthy landowners who favored taxes and the farmers and people affected by those taxes.[7] The compromise of 1790 further exacerbated this split and produced two distinct parties based on the two proposed sites in the compromise of 1790. The two parties went so far as to call themselves the ‘Chesapeake’ party and the ‘Potomac’ party perfectly exemplifying the local importance of a national issue. Even though parties and party names shifted, the specific split produced a long time rivalry which cut along geographic lines and continued well into the 1820s. The crucial spatial analysis here is that mapping allowed Swain to show that voting blocs can be spatially distinct and spatially defined in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\nIn terms of my own research, as stated earlier in this paper, there are always opportunities for spatial analysis. One idea could be mapping the printing of the federalist papers. If I could find newspapers that printed the federalist papers in each state, I could make a choropleth map that denoted instances of federalist pieces showing up in newspapers then compare this to a map of voting trends to see if the printing of federalist papers actually affected voting trends. This would point to larger questions about the role of newspapers or editorial pieces in political voting trends.\nBibliography Guldi, Jo . 2011. “What Is the Spatial Turn?” The Spatial Humanities, Scholars’ Lab, University of Virginia.
