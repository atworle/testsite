## About Me

My Name is Antonio Thomas Worley. I am a history Master's student at Clemson University.

My research focuses on 18th century America and the early republic period. I have a particular interest in the creation, circulation, and evolution of ideas, especially in the way they affect the social mind. I have a deep interest in digital history and the use of computational text analysis to reveal patterns of social and polticial thought.
