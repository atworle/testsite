&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spatial history is much more philosophical than other digital methods or techniques. It has roots that go back to the late 19th century with legal scholars, archaeologists, and historians studying the concept of the “commons” in relation to collective ownership and spatial practices.[^1] In essence, this indicates early attempts to describe the spatial experience, attributing more value and weight to the ‘spatial’. Richard White stresses the fact that spatial history is about recognizing space as a “historical actor” instead of just a backdrop for historical events.[^2] With 
Foucault and Lefebvre’s intellectual frameworks the spatial turn evolved and gained more popularity in the 1970s and 1980s.[^3] The spatial turn eventually developed strong ties to the digital turn in the 1990s, with digital tools like GIS more widely being used by historians. Digital tools such as GIS and digital mapping have the potential to bring out the spatial in historical questions. This allows for an accentuation of the driving philosophy of spatial history, which ultimately is “How is the human experience shaped by space or vice versa?”.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GIS is particularly tied to the spatial turn and spatial history because it encouraged the “reopening” of spatial questions and “enhanced the clarity” of spatial discussions.[^4] It also allowed for questions of far larger scale due to the amount of mappable information in archives. GIS has allowed the formalization of spatial analysis. This comes at a cost however; the discreteness and perceived objectivity of mapping has the potential to erode the implicit nuances of historical inquiry. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond GIS and digital mapping, understanding the epistemological roots of spatial history is crucial for understanding how it works and where it could be useful. Spatial history, at least according to its advocates, is theoretically always a useful lens to use for history. In essence, if space is viewed as an actor rather than just a backdrop, it must become a factor that every historian should consider, regardless of the time period or subjects of the study. In that way, spatial history is about teasing out the tendrils of space’s influence on history. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course there are subjects in history that have more explicit spatial elements. For example, if one was studying historical newspapers, a consideration of the inherent spatiality of newspapers would be necessary. A blatant example would be a comparison of northern and southern newspapers during the civil war. The sectional spatiality of this study would be a crucial consideration in answering any historical questions. In general, any study involving urban environments would need to grapple with spatiality. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more explicit uses for spatial analysis involve historical questions with explicit geographical or environmental underpinnings, however, a consideration of spatiality may reveal relationships or ideas not possible through typical historical analytical frameworks. Numerous digital projects use GIS or digital mapping in conjunction with spatial analysis to reveal new relationships and provide new analyses.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Visualizing Emancipation is an example of using mapping to understand and reveal relationships that may be hidden by using only normal historical methods. This project has three mappable components  “...where slavery protected by the US government and where it was not during the Civil War; where and when U.S. troops campaigned during that war; and where "emancipation events…". By mapping these things the project reveals that ‘emancipation events’ and union army positions have a spatial correlation.[^5] This relationship can really only be seen by mapping it. As an example, mapping the instances of union army contact and emancipation events show that enslaved peoples had a greater chance at freedom near rivers or the coast because union armies pushed into the confederacy by “water and rail”.[^6] Not only is this project displaying ‘patterns of emancipation’ but also this project ultimately presents the idea that emancipation was not an instanced event but it was an arduous, and oftentimes, violent process. The production of these ideas are very much tied to the spatial analysis provided by mapping. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mapping Early American Elections project has a far more explicit spatial component. The project maps voter counts of early American congressional elections, allowing one to see the dominant political parties by district. This project has a very clear spatial dimension because voting, specifically in the congressional elections, is a geographic act that is simple to display spatially. In the article, “ Maryland's Political Geography in the Early Republic”, Greta Swain uses the maps in this project to show that geography shaped Maryland’s early American elections. For context, Swain explains that at the time of ratification of the U.S constitution, Maryland had two ‘distinct voting blocs’ consisting of wealthy landowners who favored taxes and the farmers and people affected by those taxes.[7] ![mapofmarylandvotingresultsin1790](/md1790.png) The compromise of 1790 further exacerbated this split and produced two distinct parties based on the two proposed sites in the compromise of 1790. The two parties went so far as to call themselves the ‘Chesapeake’ party and the ‘Potomac’ party perfectly exemplifying the local importance of a national issue. Even though parties and party names shifted, the specific split produced a long time rivalry which cut along geographic lines and continued well into the 1820s. The crucial spatial analysis here is that mapping allowed Swain to show that voting blocs can be spatially distinct and spatially defined in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of my own research, as stated earlier in this paper, there are always opportunities for spatial analysis. One idea could be mapping the printing of the federalist papers. If I could find newspapers that printed the federalist papers in each state, I could make a choropleth map that denoted instances of federalist pieces showing up in newspapers then compare this to a map of voting trends to see if the printing of federalist papers actually affected voting trends. This would point to larger questions about the role of newspapers or editorial pieces in political voting trends.
